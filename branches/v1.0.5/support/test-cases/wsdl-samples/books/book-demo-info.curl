    The Book Finder Demonstration applet shows a simple way to make use of
    several web services in one integrated Curl applet.

{heading level = 2,
    How to Run the Book Finder Demo
}
{paragraph
    Running the Book Finder Demo is a two stage process because the demo
    requires that the Curl sources representing the web services are in place.
    In order to generate those Curl sources, run generate-wsdl-files.curl.
}
{heading level = 4,
    Generating WSDL Curl Source Packages
}
{paragraph
    The location of the WSDL files for the required web services are specified
    in the generate-wsdl-files applet. It attempts to locate the WSDL files and
    then generates Curl source packages in a wsdl/ subdirectory. The
    generate-wsdl-files.curl applet {italic {bold must}} be run from the
    filesystem in order to write the Curl sources to disk.
}
{center {image source = {url "generation.jpg"}}}
{paragraph
    Once the generated Curl sources are in place, the Book Finder Demonstration
    applet (start.curl) can be run. The applet does not need to write anything
    to disk, so it can be run either over http or from the filesystem, but it
    will require privilege in order to make web service calls. See the Web
    Services documentation for more information.

    Finding Books
}
{paragraph
    The Book Finder Demo provides the ability to search for books two ways. One
    is using an ISBN number. Enter an ISBN number in the {docref TextField}
    labeled "ISBN Search:", select a vendor from the {docref DropdownList}, then
    click the ISBN "Go" button. The {docref RecordGrid} will display the book
    with that ISBN number as returned by the web service supplied by the vendor
    you select. If you select "All" vendors, then data from all available
    vendors will be displayed.
}
{paragraph
    You can also search by keyword. Enter the keyword(s) of interest into the
    {docref TextField} labeled "Keyword Search:", select a vendor from the
    {docref DropdownList}, then click the keyword "Go" button. The
    {docref RecordGrid} will display the books associated with the keyword(s) as
    returned by the web service supplied by the vendor you select. If you select
    "All" vendors, then data from all available vendors will be displayed.
}
{paragraph
    NOTE: The services offering ISBN searches do not all offer keyword searches.
}
{heading level = 2,
    Asynchronous versus Synchronous
}
{paragraph
    The sources generated for each service contain both synchronous and
    asynchronous methods. The Book Finder Demo uses the asynchronous methods by
    default. This allows a timeout to be more easily implemented so that server
    delays and other connection-related delays can be handled sooner and more
    gracefully. The synchronous implementations are more straightforward and
    easier to understand, but are less easily controlled by the application
    developer and subject the user to potentially long delays.
