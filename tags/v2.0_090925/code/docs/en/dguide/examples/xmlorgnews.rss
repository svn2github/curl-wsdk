<p>Blogging is fun. The weblog, a hybrid of home page and personal journal, has become the most popular way for people to express themselves on the Web. Alongside it has come the rise of RSS (the expansion of this acronym is contended; choose between RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication), which finds one of its most widespread applications in the syndication of weblog items -- whether directly to desktop RSS readers, or to aggregating Web sites such as Blogdex, Meerkat, or Bloglines. In this article Edd Dumbill explains how RSS feeds from weblogs can be aggregated to enhance communication among groups of software developers, and how XML/RDF can be used to describe multiple communities.<br>

<p>RFID (radio frequency identification) tagging technology continues to gain in inventory tracking uses, as Microsoft Corp., IBM Corp. and Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV announce projects for developing and promoting it as a cost-saving tool for retailers. RFID chips, computer chips equipped with miniature antennae, store data for transmission to nearby receivers, and are increasingly being used as wireless tags to track goods. One advantage to the wireless tags is that, unlike bar codes, RFID tags can be read at any angle and from a distance. Large retail companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Tesco PLC of the U.K. and Germany's Metro AG, have been using the RFID technology and are already planning to push the technology beyond the pilot stage.<br>

Hewlett- Packard's OpenView division acquired Talking Blocks. Computer Associates acquired Adjoin. BEA Systems announced that its future WebLogic 9.0 release would focus on management. Are application platforms like BEA WebLogic and systems management tools like HP OpenView in the same market? Hardly. But both camps are trying to stake a claim on the space.

<p>Over two months have now passed since the W3C workshop on Binary Interchange. While the binary XML debate rages on in the XML community, the cautious observer will note that the discussion is shifting from a polarised and rather sterile fight to a slightly quieter conversation in which both sides of the fence try to understand issues raised by the other. In the presence of a standard XML Binary Interchange format, strong rules are required to preserve interoperability. At the very least, endpoints that only accept the binary format must have very good reasons of doing so, which is to say that they must not use the binary format as an optimization of XML, but because it is their only option. All others would have to support XML, only supporting the the binary format as an optimization option.</p>

<p>The note discusses WS-Notification and the WS-Resource Framework (Akamai, The Globus Alliance, HP, IBM, Sonic, and TIBCO) together with WS-Eventing (BEA, Microsoft and TIBCO).  'Web services have lacked a standard for event notification.  Now, two proposals for just such a standard have emerged within the space of two weeks. But unless the two vendor camps get together, users won't benefit much. If the two groups can converge the basic publish-and-subscribe specs, it would provide a foundation to later standardize more advanced aspects of event-driven computing. For now, neither of the new specs includes durable subscription or complex event processing features. Nor are either of the specs as complete as JMS, the Java Message Service specification, which does not cover Web services but which, up to now, has been the only multivendor standard available for publish-and-subscribe messaging.<br>

<p>The next version of Microsoft SQL Server, code-named &quot;Yukon,&quot; takes the groundbreaking XML support that was introduced in SQL Server 2000 and enhances it to include even more innovative functionality and ease of use. Yukon adds native XML data storage to the database management system (DBMS) through a new native XML data type. The introduction of this native XML data type, coupled with the emerging industry standard XQuery language, should spark a revolution in database application development. Support for the native XML data type is extensive. It includes XML Schema-based validation and additional XML-based constraints, special XML Infoset-based indexes, and queries over XML content objects using XQuery. In addition to this radical new functionality, the existing SQL Server 2000 XML functionality has been fine-tuned for better performance and ease of use. This article discusses Yukon's built-in ability to expose its data through Web services, and other XML features of Yukon.</p>

<p>WS-Security, a widely supported proposal for securing Web services, could become an official OASIS standard by March. OASIS in mid-February anticipates a full-membership vote on the WS-Security specification, which is intended to provide critical security for web services. If approved during a 30-day voting period, WS-Security becomes an OASIS standard. The OASIS Web Services Security Technical Committee earlier this month approved a set of documents pertaining to the specification, which is officially referred to as Web Services Security: SOAP Message Security 1.0. The specification, which was subjected to a public review as well, describes enhancements to SOAP messaging to provide for message integrity and confidentiality, according to OASIS. Related documents also approved included Username Token Profile, for using WS-Security for user names and passwords, and X.509 Certificate Token Profile, for using WS-Security to sign and encrypt messages via X.509 digital certificates, said Kelvin Lawrence, co-chairman of the OASIS committee and an IBM Distinguished Engineer.<br>

<p>One of Longhorn's most interesting technologies for developers is its ne
XML-based markup language, codenamed XAML (short for eXtensible 
Application
Markup Language, and pronounced &quot;Zammel&quot;). User interfaces in Longhorn applications are typically built using XAML. In this article, we look at how XAML relates to the underlying support provided by WinFX. XAML is a simple but powerful way of building trees of .NET objects. Because it is based on XML, it is straightforward to create XAML-based markup. This not only makes it easy to build user interfaces by hand, it also makes it relatively straightforward for tools to generate XAML -- in the future, design tools will emerge that are able to export documents and drawings in XAML format. It is also easy to use technologies such as XSLT to transform XML data sources into XAML documents. XAML enables a clean separation of user interface from code through the use of code-behind files, while its close integration with WinFX makes it very easy for code to manipulate the user interface elements defined in the markup.<br>

<p>The Third Annual XML for Financial Services conference, held in New York City, USA, casts doubt on the conventional wisdom about Web services and the role of tightly-coupled middleware in real-world XML developments. This conference is dominated by technical managers from the Financial Services industry rather than the usual idealistic and diverse cadre of XML professionals. The emphasis in discussing technology is firmly on maturity, practicality, enterprise scalability, international scope and regulatory awareness. The standards organizations that convey authority are not the likes of W3C, OASIS, WS-I or the like, but rather ISO, UN and financial regulators. Under this light mainstream Web Services are a curiosity based on intriguing propositions, but not yet proving their mettle for enterprise deployment, and running out of time to prove such mettle. The package of ebXML technologies looks to be on a more solid path to enterprise deployment in this industry, but is still not convincing managers to come out of wait-and-see mode.</p>

These products also provide design tools that allow you to build attractive XML-enabled forms quickly and easily. Microsoft's XML-oriented InfoPath, which shipped with Office 2003 in October, is now deployed and in use. Adobe plans to ship a beta version of its PDF- and XML-oriented forms designer in the first quarter of this year. And e-forms veterans such as PureEdge and Cardiff, whose offerings are built on an XML core, are lining up behind XForms, an e-forms specification that became an official W3C recommendation in October 2003. Common to all these vendors' approaches is the use of XML as the bridge between applications that gather data from end-users and the back-office systems that absorb that data.<br />

<p>The OWL Semantics and Abstract Syntax document provides a characterisation of OWL ontologies in terms of an abstract syntax. This is a high level description of the way in which we can define the characteristics of classes and properties. In addition, S&amp;AS gives a mapping to RDF triples. This tells us how such an abstract description of an OWL ontology can be transformed to a collection of RDF triples (which can then be represented in a concrete fashion using, for example RDF/XML). In order to parse an OWL-RDF file into some structure closer to the abstract syntax we need to reverse this mapping, i.e. determine what the class and property definitions were that lead to those particular triples. An OWL-RDF parser takes an RDF/XML file and attempts to construct an OWL ontology that corresponds to the triples represented in the RDF. This document describes a basic strategy that could be used in such a parser.<br />

<p>In the document/literal style of Web services, the schemas of the interchange formats are often based on an existing document standard. The XML format that is most immediately meaningful to the processing on either side is simply bundled into the envelope and transmitted as is. This means that the schema details that go into the types section of the WSDL are often just a part of a more generally used schema. It may even be a globally well known schema such as XHTML, Docbook, or one of the many XML formats for business interchange, such as UBL or OAGIS. This can cause problems synchronizing WSDL files with the standard schemata. This article shows how to use XInclude to incorporate external schema fragments into a WSDL file XInclude is simple and is supported by many XML tools. It is a handy tool for many situations, and can certainly help improve the maintenance of document/literal style WSDL documents.</p>

<p>Open source advocate Bruce Perens tells BBC technology correspondent Clark Boyd why the real threat to Linux and the open source movement is not from the SCO lawsuits, but from software patents. Perens: &quot;We're looking at a future where only the very largest companies will be able to implement software, and it will technically be illegal for other people to do so.<br />

<p>This second article in the series discusses MSXML in detail. The author uses MSXML DOM to perform a WSDL to HTML transformation in order to generate a user interface for a web service. He demonstrates the use of MSXML on both client and server sides. On the client side he uses JavaScript inside a browser and, on the server side, MSXML inside an ASP.NET page.  The article explains the WSDL to HTML transformation. It covers XML processing as well as HTML authoring with MSXML. This provides an opportunity to demonstrate several other XML processing issues, as well as some DOM-HTML authoring techniques.</p>

The purpose of the Security Components Message Exchange Format (SCIMF) is to define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information of security components, and for the management systems which may need to interact with each other. This document describes a data model to represent information exported by alert-make systems, and explains the rationale for using this model. An implementation of the data model in XML is presented, an XML Document Type Definition is developed, and examples are provided. Two implementations of the SCIMF were originally proposed to the IDWG: one using the Structure of Management Information (SMI) to describe an SNMP MIB, and the other using a Document Type Definition (DTD) to describe XML documents. SCIMF is heavily based on IDMEF and has upward compatibility with IDMEF that assures inheritance of IDMEF data structure.<br />

<p>The principal goal of this document is to help W3C Working Groups to write clearer, more implementable, and better testable technical reports. It provides both a common framework for specifying conformance requirements and definitions, and also addresses how a specification might allow variation among conforming implementations, both of which facilitate the generation of test materials. The material is presented as a set of organizing guidelines and verifiable checkpoints. This document is one in a family of Framework documents of the Quality Assurance (QA) Activity, which includes the other existing or in-progress specifications: Introduction, Operational Guidelines, and Test Guidelines.</p>

<p>Microsoft offers several Web Services to the general public including the Microsoft.com Web Service, TerraService, MapPoint Web Service, and the .NET Alerts. Developers can use all of these services to introduce valuable functionality and content into their applications. This column will provide an overview of these Web Services along with instructions on how to get started with each one. Other major organizations like Amazon.com and Google.com have also exposed some of their data and functionality through Web Services interfaces. To begin using any of these services, all you need is a WSDL file and a good Web Services toolkit like Visual Studio .NET 2003.</p>
