    {purpose
        The classes in this package comprise the code used by an applet which
        demonstrates how web services might be used in one possible use case.
    }
    {details
        The Book Finder Demonstration applet, which uses this package, follows
        a pattern for employing web services that is typical when using Curl.
        There are only a few basic steps to follow and this package provides
        the application level components to help get from a Web Service
        Description Language (WSDL) file to end-user application.
        {enumerate
            {item
                Generate Curl code (as a {docref package}) that represents the
                web service.
            }
            {item
                Load the {docref package} containing the generated Curl code.
            }
            {item
                Call the web service using the methods in the generated
                {docref package}.
            }
        }
        The following classes apply to those three steps:
        {itemize
            {item {docref BookDemoPackageGenerator}}
            {item {docref BookDemoPackageLoader}}
            {item {docref BookDemoDisplay}}
        }
        {paragraph
            The last, {docref BookDemoDisplay}, is the user-interface (UI)
            class. A user chooses what information is desired via
            {docref TextField}s and {docref DropdownLists}, then issues the
            request with a {docref CommandButton}. The UI responds to the button
            click by making the call to the web service.
        }
        {paragraph
            There are a few supporting classes that help the top level classes
            do their work. They are:
            {itemize
                {item
                    {docref BookDemoServiceData}{br}
                    This class holds information about the generated packages.
                    It also serves as a proxy for
                    {docref BookDemoPackageLoader}.
                }
                {item
                    {docref BookDemoBookInfo}{br}
                    This class is a data structure that holds the data returned
                    from the web services, allowing the application to treat the
                    data as a Curl object.
                }
                {item
                    {docref RemoteMethodDelegate}{br}
                    The {docref BookDemoDisplay} makes calls to web services
                    through this class. It deals with the specifics of calling
                    each service and handles each response in accordance with
                    that service's data format.
                }
            }
            There are two other classes, {docref ImageCell} and
            {docref VendorCell} which are just used to spruce up the display of
            results in a {docref RecordGrid}.
        }
    }
