      This message is used to obtain all of the discovered showcase implementations of 
		the WS-I services.  It contains useful information on which selections can be made, 
		such as platform, in addition to vital information about the choices, such as the
		endpoints.  The service may perform discovery in response to this message or may
		return cached information.  When the refresh bit is on, the implementation must
		perform (re)discovery.
      This message is returned in response to getConfigurationOptions and contains 
		a list of alternative showcase implementations of the WS-I Basic Sample Application
		Web services.  The endpoints for the services and information about the service is
		provided to aid in selection.
      This message is used to indicate the configurator was unable to obtain configuration options.
